            <h2>Interesting Info about Pozole</h2>
            <p>The pre-colonial form of pozole, which combined human flesh and the white cacahuazintle corn associated with Iztacmizcóatl, the White Cloud Serpent, was meaningful to the Aztecs, both culturally and ritualistically. The soup symbolized “the rite where the permanent duality of the Nahua’s mystical vision was verified: origin and end, heaven and earth, day and night, symbolized in many ways in his arts, in his philosophy and in his rites: Quetzalcóatl who crawls- flies with the serpent-eagle, in his earthly-divine condition,” writes Alfonso de Jesús Jiménez Martínez in his “Retrieving Meanings: The Ritual Meaning of Pozole in Aztec Society.”</p>
            <p>In honor of Tláloc, the god of rain and rain deities, Aztecs held a festival during February and March known as Atlcahualo—to usher in the rain needed for planting. Soon after Atlcahualo came the feast of Tlacaxipehualiztli , celebrating the year’s harvest and commemorating how the Mexica obtained and inherited corn from the Toltecs. </p>
